# zeabot-rs
A simple discord bot, written in Rust and using [Lavalink](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink), that plays music given a source. Not a good bot in anyway but a bot I made for the sake of curiosity and learning. Feel free to clone it, no credits needed.

# ⚠️Warning
I am no longer working on this repository, [zeabot-go](https://github.com/Zead0n/zeabot-go) is where I have moved to.
